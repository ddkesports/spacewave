---- MODULE SQLPrimary ----
\* A World whose block store writes to its SQL backend (sqlPrimaryStores), as
\* the single-writer deferred engine runs it with the SQL publisher
\* (bstore-sql-publish.go). Each commit is admitted under the writer lock:
\* its blocks join the publisher's overlay and queue for insertion, and the
\* engine's published head advances at once, before MariaDB holds a row.
\* Workers insert the queued blocks with INSERT IGNORE, several at a time and
\* in any order. The committer writes the durable head of commit k to s4db
\* (the local publisher) only after commit k's rows landed and commit k-1's
\* head was written, so the durable head advances one commit at a time. A
\* head that fails to commit fails every commit admitted after it, and the
\* engine reinstalls from the durable head; their queued blocks still land.
\* In-process readers read through the overlay; peers and a restarted backend
\* read the durable head through the local bucket, read only, then SQL. The
\* uploader keeps copying the blocks its markers name from the bucket to SQL.
\*
\* Before the switch the head r0 and the block o it references sit in the
\* bucket with upload markers pending. Commit 1 writes the root n1, which
\* references o; commit 2 writes n2, which references n1 and o. A failed
\* insert stays queued and its worker retries it after a back-off. A restart
\* drops the overlay and the commits after the durable head, and may remount
\* with SQL primary off when Rollback holds: commits then write to the
\* bucket, and the account GC cleanup and eviction run again. The GC sweeps
\* bucket blocks its ref graph cannot reach from either head; the graph
\* records the references only of blocks written to the bucket.
\*
\* The World engine (core/sobject/world/engine) serves writers the admitted
\* head mem and readers the durable head rd, which installs each commit once
\* its head is durable and keeps the World before a failed one. A writer
\* forks under the engine's writer lock, runs its body, during which the
\* consumer (Hyperline) takes its own lock, and commits; CommitAdmit releases
\* the writer lock at admission, and the consumer releases its lock after.
\* A failed head is settled under the writer lock, by the receipt's watcher or
\* by the next writer as it forks: the admitted head returns to the durable
\* one and the reinstall hook, which takes the consumer's lock, reports it. A
\* commit whose base follows a failed head fails without settling it.
\* SettleInCommit models the earlier engine, which settled inside the commit
\* and ran the hook on the writer's goroutine.
\*
\* Not modeled: peers, the decoded cache, which holds only blocks already read,
\* the chunking of a commit's blocks, whose rows the committer waits for as a
\* whole, a block shared with an earlier commit, which that commit inserts
\* and commits first, and the admission bound, which only delays Commit.

EXTENDS Naturals

\* AckDurable: MariaDB has made a row durable when its INSERT returns, as
\* innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit = 1 does.
AckDurable == TRUE
\* Rollback: a restart may turn SQL primary off.
Rollback == FALSE
\* SettleInCommit: a commit settles a failed head itself, running the hook
\* while its writer holds the consumer's lock.
SettleInCommit == FALSE

\* A writer takes the writer lock and forks from the admitted head. A failed
\* head is settled first: the admitted head returns to the durable one and
\* the hook reports it, before the body takes the consumer's lock.
Fork ==
  /\ wst = "idle" /\ wlock = "free" /\ mem < MaxCommit

\* The body takes the consumer's lock and writes.
Body ==
  /\ wst = "forked"
  /\ held' = TRUE /\ wst' = "body"
  /\ UNCHANGED <<store, mem, rd, failed, wlock, base>>

\* CommitAdmit writes the root: into the overlay under SQL primary, into the
\* bucket, with its marker and graph edges, otherwise. The admitted head
\* advances before any row lands, and the writer lock is released. A commit
\* whose base follows a failed head fails, leaving the failure to the
\* watcher or the next writer; under SettleInCommit it settles it, which
\* waits for the consumer's lock its own writer holds.

  /\ held' = FALSE /\ wst' = "idle"

\* The receipt's watcher takes the writer lock after a failure, then settles

\* The durable head installs the next durable commit for readers.
Promote ==
  /\ rd < dur
  /\ rd' = rd + 1
  /\ UNCHANGED <<store, mem, failed, wlock, wst, base, held>>

\* runWorker: one insert lands any queued block, in any order, and drops it
\* from the overlay. A failed insert keeps it queued; the stutter is its
\* back-off.
Drain ==
  /\ dbUp
  /\ \E b \in buf : Store({b}) /\ buf' = buf \ {b}
  /\ UNCHANGED <<mode, mem, dur, dbUp, local, marker, edges, eng>>

\* runCommitter: once the next commit's rows landed, its head commits to
\* s4db after the one before it. A local-store commit writes its head at
\* once, its blocks already in the bucket.
Sync ==
  /\ dur < mem /\ ~failed
  /\ RootOf(dur + 1) \notin buf
  /\ dur' = dur + 1
  /\ UNCHANGED <<mode, mem, buf, dbUp, rows, acked, local, marker, edges, eng>>

\* The next head fails to commit: it and every commit admitted after it
\* fail, and readers keep the durable head. The engine settles the failure
\* under the writer lock. Their queued blocks still land, as rows no head
\* reaches.
SyncFail ==
  /\ dur < mem /\ ~failed
  /\ failed' = TRUE
  /\ UNCHANGED <<mode, mem, dur, buf, dbUp, rows, acked, local, marker, edges,
                 rd, wlock, wst, base, held>>

\* The uploader copies a marked block from the bucket to SQL.
Upload ==

\* Eviction, off under SQL primary, drops an uploaded block from the bucket.
Evict ==
  /\ mode = "local"
  /\ \E b \in local \ marker :

       /\ local' = local \ {b}
  /\ UNCHANGED <<mode, mem, dur, buf, dbUp, rows, acked, marker, edges, eng>>

\* The account GC cleanup, off under SQL primary, sweeps bucket blocks the
\* graph cannot reach from the durable head or the engine's pinned head, with
\* their markers.
GraphReach ==
  LET roots == {RootOf(dur), RootOf(mem), RootOf(rd)}

\* MariaDB crashes, losing the rows it had not made durable, and restarts.
DbCrash ==
  /\ dbUp' = FALSE /\ acked' = {}

DbRestart ==
  /\ ~dbUp /\ dbUp' = TRUE
  /\ UNCHANGED <<mode, mem, dur, buf, rows, acked, local, marker, edges, eng>>

\* The backend crashes or restarts: it loses the overlay and the commits
\* after the durable head, whose rows may have landed already, and remounts,
\* with SQL primary off when Rollback holds. The writer and the engine's locks
\* end with it, and the new engine serves readers the durable head.
Restart ==
  /\ mem' = dur /\ buf' = {}
  /\ mode' \in IF Rollback THEN {"sql", "local"} ELSE {"sql"}
  /\ rd' = dur /\ failed' = FALSE /\ wlock' = "free" /\ wst' = "idle"

\* What a store holds: the bucket, and MariaDB's rows.
Stored == local \cup rows \cup acked

\* Every block the durable head reaches stays stored, so a restarted backend
\* and every peer reads it.
DurableStored == Reach(dur) \subseteq Stored
\* The durable head reaches only rows MariaDB holds: the root of every
\* durable commit has landed.
DurableRows == \A k \in 1..dur : RootOf(k) \in rows \cup acked
\* A reader of the engine's published head finds each block it reaches in the
\* overlay or a store, so no reader sees a commit before its blocks.
PublishedReadable == Reach(mem) \subseteq buf \cup Stored
\* Readers see only durable commits, and find every block they reach.
ReadersDurable == rd <= dur /\ Reach(rd) \subseteq Stored
\* Nothing settles while a writer holds the writer lock, so a commit lands
\* on the head its writer forked from and is never replayed onto another.
ForkedHead == wst \in {"forked", "body"} => base = mem

\* Liveness, under the fairness below: once MariaDB stays up, the durable
\* head keeps catching up with the published one, and readers with it,
\* without a restart. Fairness on Drain stands for workers that retry a
\* failed insert. A failure is settled and the writer finishes: the hook
\* never waits for a lock its own writer holds.
